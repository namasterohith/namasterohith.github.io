# Namaste World!

My name is **Rohith Radhakrishnan**.

I am a web enthusiast turned hybrid app developer turned product person. I like being _Geeky_, which makes me _Happy_.


### About what I do:
```
TL;DR:
1."Aha!" Moments === My Coding Caffeine.
2. Geek in general.
3. HTML + CSS + JS FTW!!
```


The satisfaction one gets when making or fixing something is the driving force for me and building a successful career as an engineer gives me the same. With ever growing technology, possiblties are endless.

Am a web enthusiast and I used to be synchronous and static, but then I felt The Force! I mean I found out where all JavaScript had got in, still figuring it out and forever will be. By its wonders I have now evolved into a web and hybrid mobile app developer.

I now work on the technical side of an early stage startup. From developer to analyst, to project manager to something new. Switching between roles keeps me excited here in this fast paced environment. This helps me pick-up new skills and also brings the joy of solving problems on a day-to-day basis.

I also love football, music and gaming.

Currently I am working with: [zenda...](https://www.zenda.com/)
